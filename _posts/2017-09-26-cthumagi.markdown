description: Low Rez Jam 2017
---
Originally made for the LowResJam 2017, Cthulhu Magica is my first attempt at a J-RPG.

The original idea for the game was the mixing of Lovecraftian inspired creatures and the world of Magical Girls, but it served as a personnal challenge for the most part as I finally managed to create a Text Editor in Unity that allows me to write branching dialogue. Post-jam, I am remaking the game from scratch to improve the tools I made and i'm setting the game's resolution to 256*192px. 

Made with Unity, all assets were produced during the time of the jam.
