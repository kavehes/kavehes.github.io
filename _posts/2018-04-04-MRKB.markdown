Second year student project.  
Ascend is a Third-Person Shooter set inside a gigantic tower draining the world of a mysterious liquid which destroyed the environment around it. Your task is to get to the top of the tower to learn more about what's happening to the world and put an end to the tower. But beware, as the inhabitants of the tower won't let you up so easily.
